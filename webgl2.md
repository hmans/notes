# WebGL2

## Tutorials:

- [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/), the classic tutorial site.
- [Andrew Adamson's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T6EbWCq99c&list=PLPbmjY2NVO_X1U1JzLxLDdRn4NmtxyQQo) has a pretty cool tutorial series on programming WebGL2 from scratch.
- [tsherif/webgl2examples](https://github.com/tsherif/webgl2examples) has a bunch of examples for "typical things to do with WebGL2" without any extra bastraction, just plain WebGL2 invocations.

## Libraries:

- https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix "is designed to perform vector and matrix operations stupidly fast! By hand-tuning each function for maximum performance and encouraging efficient usage patterns through API conventions, glMatrix will help you get the most out of your browsers Javascript engine."
