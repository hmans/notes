# Unity

A collection of notes, links and tips collected through my own Unity learning journey. Please don't read this a full guide or anything; it's just stuff that I've picked up and wanted to keep for later. (But maybe you will find it useful, too!)

Questions/suggestions? I'm [@hmans on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmans).

### Tips & Tweaks

- `npx gitignore unity` will set up a `.gitignore` file for your Unity project (powered by the [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.)

### Resources

- [Unity Development with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity), if you're using that editor (as I am.)

### Useful Packages

- [Open Source Unity Package Registry](https://openupm.com/) aka OpenUPM. Use this to install non-Asset Store packages available on the net.
- [Smart Inspector](https://github.com/neon-age/Smart-Inspector) cleans up your inspector by giving you direct-access tabs for commonly used components.
