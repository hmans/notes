# Unity

### Tips & Tweaks

- `npx gitignore unity` will set up a `.gitignore` file for your Unity project (powered by the [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.)

### Resources

- [Unity Development with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity), if you're using that editor (as I am.)

### Useful Packages

- [Smart Inspector](https://github.com/neon-age/Smart-Inspector) cleans up your inspector by giving you direct-access tabs for commonly used components.
